Ex-priest Stephen H. Donnelly’s memoir, A Saint and a Sinner, is an immersive experience into the world of a Catholic priest and a brutally honest account of Stephen’s journey of sinfulness. At age 42, Stephen was ordained a Roman Catholic priest. As he stood before God, the bishop, and the congregation, he made promises he struggled to keep. Three years into his priesthood, he descended into a world of cocaine and alcohol abuse. Fellow priests intervened, and after multiple stints in rehab, Stephen turned his life around and became well-known in Alcoholics Anonymous circles as the “Irish priest with a problem. During his seven years as

Title: Unexpected
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2020
Review: We considered Father Donnelly our family priest: he was the officiant at our daughter’s wedding and later baptized her triplet sons. As a parishioner of St. Patrick’s Church in Huntington I heard a rumor that he had written a book. I was aware of his sobriety but soon discovered a lot more than I had expected about this man; I consider him very brave for sharing his story. The book also helps clear up some rumors of why he left St. Patrick’s Church and about that cryptic note in the bulletin from the Diocese about Father Donnelly’s departure. The book is beautifully written: I cried, I laughed, I felt proud at times, while I also worried about his sanity as he struggled between Satan and God. Overall great book. I would have enjoyed it whether or not I knew Father Donnelly.

Review: Just finished and couldn't put it down. Excellent story of the struggles so many endure in the places that seem least likely. My family had the good fortune of hearing many of Stephen's homilies and he was a treasure during the time he spent at St. Patricks.

Review: As a born and raised Catholic, i felt this was an extremely compelling TRUE story about a beloved priest who faced many “human and real” challenges in his life. It does not “bash” the Catholic Church and as a matter of fact the church tried to help Stephen many different times. It’s about the choices we make in life and the consequences attached to them. You will not be able to put the book down! Bravo to this first time author and Stephen Donnelly for sharing his story and “humanizing” the priesthood!

Title: AStarkReminder
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 16, 2020
Review: This book has been a long time coming and it did not disappoint. It gives us a glimpse into the real world that clergy face behind the scenes. So much is expected of them, but people forget that they are human, and face the same problems that they are expected to counsel their parishioners through.Fr. Stephen’s sharing his story is a reminder to us all that of the loneliness and difficulties that they face, and that we need to extend the grace to them that we expect from them.Fr. Stephen gave so much to our community; I hope he knows we are still grateful and think of him often.

Title: GoodButNotGreat
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 1, 2022
Review: The book is too long. It could and should have been condensed by 20%. I admired, certainly, the priest for his courage and desire to share his story to inspire others, but at some point I could not help but feel it sent overboard about how great he is, and cherished by the community. Codependents do have need to feel superior. I found that a little much to deal with. OTOH, admitting weakness is a sign of strength, and telling your story to inspire and help others is very kind and charitable. So I think the book was good. This book and another has opened my eyes to the fact that some laity did take advantage of the opportunity to assail priests for no valid reason. And regarding the power hungry in charge Sacristan mentioned, I have some across these, and gone to my battle stations.

Review: What a topsy-turvy adventure in Catholic priesthood Fr. Stephen had! I appreciated the stark honesty Stephen had telling of his addictions and sexual misadventures. Though I was sad that he is no longer practicing in active ministry as an ordained priest, I was delighted that he was able to remain clean and sober for many years. I hope he is finding serenity, joy, and fulfillment in his current life!

Title: Sadstory
Date: Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2022
Review: While I understand Stephen’s need to tell his story, there are elements that I don’t understand. Why did Stephen find it necessary to use the names of accused priests? Why, given all the life lessons he learned, did Stephen exonerate himself by claiming that his actions hurt only himself? What about Camilla and Anna? Does he bear any responsibility for the hurt they must have experienced? Those are questions I think Stephen needs to grapple with in order to truly come to terms with the life he chose.

Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 9, 2020
Review: I am a believing Catholic. I didn’t know Father Donnelly but Father Nelson as a pastor of my parish, St. Anne’s, Brentwood.The priesthood is a difficult life. The book develops the land mines that confront a priest. He is human and only as strong as his prayer life strengthens.Father Donnelly should be admired for the many good things he did as a priest. Unfortunately his weakness were too difficult to overcome. His addictions were fought with support of others.His womanizing he was left to fight alone. This fight he lost.
